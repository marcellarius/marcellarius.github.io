			You can communicate (briefly), and you can also interact with one object for free as
			part of your movement/action, for example you can open a door as part of your movement,
			or draw a weapon as part of an attack.  Further interactions will require you to use an
			action.

		<h4>Death</h4>
		
	<p>
		When reduced to 0 hp, a creature is unconscious and unstable, and must
		start making death saving throws.
	</p>

	<div class="action">
		<p>
			<span class="action-heading">Massive damage</span>
			If the remaining damage after reducing a creature to 0 hp exceeds
			its maximum hit points, the creature dies immediately.
		</p>
	</div>

		
	<p>
		When you start your turn unstable at 0 hp, you must make a death saving 
		throw (DC10, no modifier) After 3 successes you become stable, after 3 
		failures you die.
	</p>
	<div class="action">
		<p>
			<span class="action-heading">Rolling a 1 or 20</span>
			Rolling a 1 counts as two failures. If you roll a 20, you immediately
			regain 1 hp and are conscious.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="action">
		<p>
			<span class="action-heading">Damage at 0 hp</span>
			If you take damage at 0 hp, you suffer a death saving throw failure.
			A critical hit counts as two failures.
		</p>
	</div>


		<h4>Stabilising</h4>
		
	<p>
		You can make a <span class="ability-check">DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine)</span>
		to administer first aid to an unstable creature as an action. On a success
		the creature becomes stable, but unconscious. It no longer makes death saving
		throws, but if it suffers any damage it will become unstable again. 
	</p>
	<p>Without healing, a stable creature regains 1 hp after 1d4 hours</p>

	<div class="action">
		<p>
			<span class="action-heading">Potion of healing</span>
			Instantly restores 2d4 + 2 hit points.
		</p>
	</div>


		<h4>Resting</h4>
		
	<div class="action">
		<p>
			<span class="action-heading">Short rest</span>
			At least one hour. After resting a character can expend hit dice 
			to regain hit points.  Roll hit dice, add con modifier.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="action">
		<p>
			<span class="action-heading">Long rest</span>
			At least eight hours. After resting, a character replenishes all
			hit points, and regains half of their total hit dice (round down), 
			but at least one.
			A character can only benefit from one long rest per day.
