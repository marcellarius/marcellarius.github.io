					<h2>Recent Projects</h2>
										
					<div class="recent-project">
						<h4>Sea Shell Database <small>(2015-2017)</small></h4>
						<p>
							This project delivers a web application to manage records for a large
							private sea-shell collection. I built this application from scratch to
							move specimen records into a well-structured database. The application
							uses Flask and PostgreSQL. Most of the logic is server-side using Bootstrap 3
							and Backbone.js in the front-end.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Scraping valuable specimen details from typo-filled text.</li>
							<li>Providing a fast, easy-to-use interface for non-technical users</li>
							<li>Trees in a relational DB, with efficient subtree queries</li>
							<li>Acquire domain knowledge about zoological taxonomy</li>
							<li>Interfacing with third-party web APIs</li>
							<li>Full text search, fuzzy/partial matching, typeahead search UI</li>
							<li>Generating printable specimen labels using HTML/CSS</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="recent-project">
						<h4>Job Tracking System <small>(2016)</small></h4>
						<p>
							I put this web app together for Eastbay Metering's internal use to
							track jobs, scanned paperwork, and digital photos. It is a
							responsive single-page application using Bootstrap, Backbone.js, and a RESTful JSON
							API provided by a Flask/PostgreSQL back-end.
						 </p>
						<ul>
							<li>Fast, mobile-friendly interface (SPA, history API)</li>
							<li>Real-time updates, activity event logging</li>
							<li>File and photo uploads, thumbnailing, drag and drop</li>
							<li>Flexible admin UI for creation of new job types and actions</li>
						</ul>
					</div>

					<div class="recent-project">
						<h4>Online Computer Wargame <small>(2010-2014)</small></h4>
						<p>
							I worked in a small team developing a computer
							adaptation of a WW2 wargame. We developed this in
							C# using Direct3D for graphics. My work on this
							project covered all areas of the game's
							development including design and technology
							choices, architecture, graphics, UI, networking,
							tooling, and web.
							The editing tools we created also produced maps
							for professional printing for the board game version.
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Building editing tools for creating huge stylised maps</li>
							<li>Exporting maps for professional printing</li>
							<li>Understanding and implementing a complex rule set</li>
							<li>Nested state-machine architecture for UI and game logic</li>
							<li>Asynchronous network play using cloud-based servers</li>
							<li>Working with XML. Serialization, custom code generators</li>
							<li>Integrating the Chromium browser for the game UI</li>
							<li>Embedded Lua VM and API for scenario scripting</li>
							<li>.NET performance profiling and analysis</li>

					<h2>Academic</h2>
					<p>
						I studied computer science at the University of Waikato from
						2006&ndash;2010 after receiving a scholarship during high school.  
					</p>
					<p>
						My academic interests were software development, graphics and video games,
						low-level programming, operating systems, and programming languages. I
						also took cognitive and perceptual psychology courses through to third year.
					</p>
					<p>
						Starting in my second year I worked as a sessional assistant for the computer
						science department. This involved helping students understand and debug lab
						work, marking exercises, and supervising tests.
					</p>
					<p> 
						As part of a summer research placement in the WAND group, I was directly
						involved with setting up the University's new cluster computer. My work on
						this included researching, benchmarking, and deploying a cluster filesystem
						(GlusterFS); as well as learning, packaging, and setting up a job scheduling
						system (PBS).
					</p>
					<p>
						My honours research project was making a distributed model checker that ran
						on the cluster, using the combined processing and memory of many computers
						to verify huge state spaces. My real interest was in the software
						development aspect rather formal methods research (to my supervisor's
						disappointment).
					</p>
					<p>
						At the end of 2009 I took an opportunity to work full-time on a video game
						project, and I studied part-time in 2010. I am two first-year papers short
						of being eligible to graduate with a BCMS(Hons).
					</p>
					<p>
						During university I took part in several programming
						competitions, both NZPC and ACM-ICPC South Pacific; as well as machine
						learning challenges.
					</p>
					<hr>
					<p>
						I play the drums and bass guitar, enjoy coffee, cooking, tabletop RPGs,
						video games, cars and sim-racing. I'm comfortable repairing things and can
						brandish a screwdriver, spanner or soldering iron if needed.

				<h3>Academic Marks</h3>
				<p> 
					As explained in the academic section of my CV, while I have
					completed most of the study towards a BCMS(Hons) at the University
					of Waikato, I am still a couple of 1st year papers short of the
					Honours degree.
