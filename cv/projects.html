			<h2>Shell Database</h2>
			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-6">
					<p>
						The goal of this project was to modernise the record keeping
						for a large sea shell collection. A specimen is worthless
						without details of when and where it was collected.
						Furthermore, scientific consensus on taxonomy
						changes as more research is done, so it often becomes
						necessary to update the classification of specimens in the
						database.
					</p>
					<p>
						This was previously done with paper records, and while much of
						the data had been shifted into Word documents, this was prone
						to errors and difficult to search. Past attempts at setting up
						an Access database had been rejected because they were too
						hard to use.
					</p>
					<p>
						To solve this, a modern web application was designed
						and developed that would make it easy to add and
						update records, while helping to ensure consistent
						spellings and avoiding accidental data loss.
					</p>

					<p>
						The database stores a taxonomic tree and efficiently
						generates all scientific names from this. This
						normalisation made it much easier to build tools to
						tidy up the taxonomy, such as moving entire genera
						between families.
					</p>

			<h2>Online Wargame</h2>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="col-xs-6">
					<p>
						This is a computer adaptation of a turn-based board game
						simulating World War 2 at operational scale. A large
						scenario will have hundreds or thousands of units in play, each
						unit is a little cardboard chit that get stacked into awkward
						piles on a vast map.
					</p>
					<p>
						This style of game appeals to a particular hardcore military
						simulation buff but the impracticality of these large-scale
						games, and sparse network of players makes computer play-aids
						or games quite appealing.
					</p>
					<p>
						We aimed to make a more modern solution that captured
						the aesthetic of the tabletop games, had
						flexible and easy multiplayer and a complete rules
						implementation.
					</p>					
					<p>
						Challenges included visualising and communicating
						information to the players, balancing between fidelity
						to the board game and what works in a turn-based
						computer game, and keeping game servers lightweight to
						reduce operating costs.
					</p>
					<p>
						The game was developed in partnership with a Scottish
						game developer and the editing toolchain we created
						could produce output for large-format printing.
					</p>

			<h3>Map Editor</h3>

			<p class="lead">
				We created a bespoke editing tool which allowed us to use the
				same artwork for the computer game and print. Within 8 months
				we had built this tool from scratch, got it into the hands of
				our mappers, and met the optimistic deadlines for printing.
			</p>

			<h4>Noteworthy features</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Imported coastline data from GIS databases</li>
				<li>Choice of several map projections + rotation to find the best framing for the area you want to map</li>
				<li>All the niceties you'd expect: multi-step undo/redo (command based), autosave</li>
				<li>MVC architecture, allowing code reuse in game</li>
				<li>Fast and fluid: hardware accelerated graphics + efficient updates kept it responsive</li>
				<li>Sweet zoom and pan controls make moving around a breeze</li>
				<li>Map out large area, then define map sections for cropping and export</li>
				<li>Deformer tools to non-destructively fettle coastlines to fit a hex grid</li>
				<li>File format backwards compatibility: we needed to deliver fast and iterate, compatibility was high priority</li>
				<li>SVG Export: high quality vector output to render for print</li>
			</ul>
